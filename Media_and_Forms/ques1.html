    <h4>Some Quotes said by Alakh Pandey Sir :-</h4>
    <p>1. "A major part of the young workforce in India remains unemployed despite having the relevant qualifications. Because they lack the skills that are required in todayâ€™s job industry. The availability of these skills at a seemingly high cost makes the situation even worse. PW Skills is designed to address these gaps and make job seekers future-ready."</p>

Our new curriculum is vetted and designed by multiple experts within a particular course per domain expertise. It will be fused with multiple projects/assignments to provide learners with a highly structured learning path."</p>
